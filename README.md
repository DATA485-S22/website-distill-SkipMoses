# Feedback
Since i can't find the feedback PR that github classroom should have created for you, i'm going to leave your feedback here. You are welcome to "talk" to me back but know that at the moment this file is public. There are ways to change that status that we can talk about. 

The main comment I have so far, is twofold
1. The blog post https://data485-s22.github.io/website-distill-SkipMoses/posts/2022-02-09-my-name/ doesn't have a very good slug. Right now it is `my-name`. You can update this in the YAML header to make it more meaningful. The MATLAB post is awesome. 
2. The prose in this post is more like a HW problem. I know that it's faster to just write up the math part, but annotation and explanation is important for the reader.
